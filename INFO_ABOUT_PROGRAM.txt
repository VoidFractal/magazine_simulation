This program is simple simulation of store with cars, buses and bikes. 
The client is asking the questions about vehicles. Questions are contained in the question_file.txt (this file can contain more than one question).

The format of question is following: 
Brand_Model, question_from_the_list_of_questions (list_of_questions.txt)
Example: Ford_Probe, what_engine_capacity


There is a "virtual magazine". This "magazine" contains concrete vehicels in files: cars.txt,  buses.txt and bikes.txt.
If vehicle from the question is present in the "magazine", then program anserws the client question.
Otherwise, program respond that vehicle is not avaliable.

"Magazine" can "grow" over time but vehicles must be added in following format:
Brand_Model_ProductionYear_EngineCapacity_Weight_NumberOfWheels_NumberOfWindshields_NumberOfEntrances
Example: Toyota_Celica_1995_1.8_1200_4_6_3

For bikes numbers of windshields and entrances are not important but it seems the most logical to put zero for both these values.
Example: MTB_Indiana_2021_0_20_2_0_0
